# Anti-Fraud-System
Part of my learning journey at JetBrains Academy, stage 6/6.
This project demonstrates (in a simplified form) the principles of anti-fraud systems in the financial sector.  
It has a set of REST endpoints responsible for interacting with users, and an internal transaction validation 
logic based on a set of heuristic rules.
